## Entry 002 - 2026-03-29 - Standardized Workflow Logging Entries

- Task: Ensure the logging skill correctly updates this log using numbered, dated entries with clear execution and verification details.
- What the agent did: Updated the logging skill to require a strict entry schema and migrated this progress log to that schema.
- How the agent did it: Reviewed current skill and log files, defined required entry fields and rules in the skill, then rewrote log entries into the mandated format.
- Files edited:
	- .github/skills/workflow-logging/SKILL.md
	- logging/progress_log.md
- Verification:
	- Checked that each log entry is numbered, dated (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`), and has a quick title.
	- Checked that each entry includes: task, what was done, how it was done, files edited, verification steps, and task alignment (fulfillment/deviation).
- Task alignment:
	- Fulfillment: Implements the exact entry-format requirements requested for ongoing agent logging.
	- Deviation: None.

## Entry 003 - 2026-03-29 - Added Automatic Remote Commit Logging

- Task: Add automatic branch-sectioned logging for commits pushed to remote, as an extension of commit messages.
- What the agent did: Added a new remote commit logging skill, extended logging workflow guidance, created a `post-push` hook script that appends detailed commit/file data by branch, and initialized the commit log file.
- How the agent did it: Researched git hook behavior, updated skill governance surfaces, implemented hook automation in `.githooks/post-push`, and wired documentation in skills and logs.
- Files edited:
	- .github/skills/SKILL_MAP.md
	- .github/skills/workflow-logging/SKILL.md
	- .github/skills/remote-commit-logging/SKILL.md
	- .githooks/post-push
	- logging/commit_log.md
	- logging/progress_log.md
- Verification:
	- Confirmed skill map includes the new skill and registry path.
	- Confirmed hook script exists and has valid shell syntax.
	- Confirmed repository hooks path is set to `.githooks` (`git config --get core.hooksPath`).
	- Ran simulated push payload through `.githooks/post-push` and verified branch-grouped commit output with file-level details.
	- Confirmed commit log file exists with automation header.
	- Confirmed diagnostics show no markdown/frontmatter issues for edited skill/log files.
- Task alignment:
	- Fulfillment: Provides automatic remote-push commit logging grouped by branch with commit-level file details.
	- Deviation: None.
